# A C++ implementation of the sir and logistics models for pandemic prediction.
// introduction
## The sir model.
The SIR model is a mathematical model used in statistics to study the evolution and spread of diseases. It is a compartimental and deterministic model, which divides the population into three categories: susceptibles (those who can be infected), infected (those who can infect) and removed (those who nor can be infected, nor can infect). The transitions from one group the another can happen only one way, , and are defined by three ODEs.
