# A C++ implementation of the sir and logistics models for pandemic prediction.
While preparing the C++ programming exam I got interested in pandemic models and pandemic simulation. The SIR 
model and the logistic model, which I implement as argument of the exam, are two of them, but there is a lot 
more. I plan to keep updated this project and to implement more model, or to refine the ones I have already 
implemented by gathering more data and analyzing them. Pleasae feel free to copy, fork and improve this 
directory.
## The sir model.
The SIR model is a mathematical model used in statistics to study the evolution and spread of diseases. It is a 
compartimental and deterministic model, which divides the population into three categories: susceptibles (those 
who can be infected), infected (those who can infect) and removed (those who nor can be infected, nor can 
infect). The transitions from one group the another can happen only one way, , and are defined by three ODEs.
