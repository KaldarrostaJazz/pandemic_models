\section{Testing and conclusions}

In addition to the test written in the source code, it is interesting to cross test the programs.

Simulating a pandemic with either the SIR or the graphic simulator will produce data that fit perfectly with both the fitting programs. A friend and colleague of ours \href{https://github.com/P2-718na/pandemic-simulation}{Matteo Bonacini} has implement a pandemic simulator based on AI. We have had fun fitting the data he provided us and the result is a wonderful agreement between his and our model, proving that either both of them are right, either are wrong (e.g. see \href{https://github.com/KaldarrostaJazz/pandemic_models/blob/main/logistic_model_forecasts/sati.md}{here}). However, the capability of our models to fit the the real-world data, makes more probable the first option. 

You can find some of those fitting in the \verb!data_and_pdfs! folder of the \verb!files! directory. All the files related to Matteo's project go under the name "matteo*".

We hope you will find our work as fun as we had and that you share the same love for data analysis as we do.
